# AbstractDownloading
The purpose of the library is to abstract the downloading (images, pdf, zip, etc) and caching of remote resources (images, JSON, XML, etc). Resources which are reused often should not be continually re-downloaded and should be cached

Abstract Downloading is very useful project for downloading and caching remote images to the iOS application.
